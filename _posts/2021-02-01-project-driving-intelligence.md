While driving, humans encounter abundant information, selectively focus on crucial details, and make rapid decisions. This project aims to develop driving intelligence that replicates the efficient selection-and-concentration process observed in human perception systems.


We applied the attention mechanism to driving intelligence, emphasizing crucial information and disregarding less important details. This allows for high-precision perception with fewer computations.


The developed perception system processes real-time 2D and 3D data in urban environments, delivering high-accuracy perception results for safe autonomous driving.
