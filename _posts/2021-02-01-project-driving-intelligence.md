title: Research on human-level driving intelligence for autonomous driving of unmanned vehicles
categories: Project
excerpt: During urban driving, drivers encounter a vast amount of information, including other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, traffic lights, and traffic signs. Human drivers selectively focus on and concentrate on essential information for driving, allowing them to make fast decisions. This project aims to develop driving intelligence that emulates the efficient selection and concentration observed in human perception systems, allowing for effective decision-making.

During urban driving, drivers encounter a vast amount of information, including other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, traffic lights, and traffic signs. Human drivers selectively focus on and concentrate on essential information for driving, allowing them to make fast decisions. This project aims to develop driving intelligence that emulates the efficient selection and concentration observed in human perception systems, allowing for effective decision-making.


The project team incorporated the attention mechanism from the field of deep learning into driving intelligence. The attention mechanism highlights important parts of the data and omits less relevant portions, allowing for high-precision perception with relatively fewer computations. As a result of research and development, the project team developed an efficient perception system that can process a large amount of data collected from urban driving, enabling fast computation and accurate perception.
