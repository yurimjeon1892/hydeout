This project studies driving intelligence that mimics human perception systems. During urban driving, human drivers encounter a vast amount of data, including other vehicles, pedestrians, motorcycles, traffic lights, and traffic signs. Humans selectively process the relevant data for driving.

Inspired by the selective perception, we conducted research on driving intelligence that can efficiently process the massive amount of data received in real-time. To achieve this, we introduced the attention mechanism, a prominent concept in the deep learning field. The attention mechanism emphasizes important parts of the data while ignores less relevant parts, enabling high-accuracy perception with relatively fewer computations. 

As a result, we developed a perception system that can efficiently process the large amount of data collected by vehicles during urban driving, enabling fast computation and accurate recognition.
