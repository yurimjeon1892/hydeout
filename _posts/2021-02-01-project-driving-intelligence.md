While driving, humans encounter vast amounts of information, selectively focus on key details, and make quick decisions. This project aims to develop driving intelligence that replicates the efficient selection and concentration processes observed in human perception systems.


We applied the attention mechanism to driving intelligence, highlighting crucial information while disregarding less important details. This approach enables high-precision perception with fewer computations.


The developed perception system processes real-time 2D and 3D data in urban environments, delivering highly accurate perception results for safe autonomous driving."
