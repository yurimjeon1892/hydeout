This project aims to develop the perception system for unmanned vehicles in off-road scenarios.

Until now, many methods have been researched and developed for autonomous vehicles driving on structured paved roads. However, non-standard off-road environments present new challenges to autonomous driving research.

In terms of perception, off-road environments are characterized by:

* The traversable space is not clearly defined: The driving intelligence must comprehensively consider the given spatial and visual data to distinguish traversable spaces.
* The environment varies depending on seasons: The same area can look completely different in lush summer and snowy winter. It also makes it difficult to use pre-generated maps in these environments.

Considering these characteristics, we develop a perception system that demonstrates robust performance in off-road driving.
