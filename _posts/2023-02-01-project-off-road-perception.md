Autonomous driving on structured urban roads has been widely researched to date. However, unstructured off-road environments present new challenges in autonomous driving research. This project aims to develop a perception system for unmanned robots in off-road scenarios.

From a perception perspective, off-road environments exhibit the following characteristics:

* Ambiguous definition of traversable space: In off-road, the driving intelligence must comprehensively consider the given spatial and visual data to distinguish traversable spaces.
* Environmental variations with seasons: Even in the same area, the environment can look entirely different in lush summer and snowy winter. 

Taking these features into account, the project team developed a perception system that demonstrates robust performance in off-road driving.
