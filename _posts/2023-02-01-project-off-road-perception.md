Unstructured off-road environments pose new challenges for autonomous driving. This project focuses on developing a perception system for unmanned vehicles in off-road scenarios.

Off-road environments have the following characteristics:

* Ambiguous definition of traversable space: In off-road scenarios, driving intelligence must consider spatial and visual data comprehensively to distinguish traversable spaces.
* Environmental changes according to seasons: Even in the same area, the environment can look entirely different in the dense foliage of summer compared to the snow-covered winter.

We have successfully developed perception system to support the safe driving of vehicles in off-road environments, completing unmanned exploration experiments in mountainous terrain.
