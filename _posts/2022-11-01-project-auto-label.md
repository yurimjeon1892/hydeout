Creating high-quality large-scale datasets is a essential element in artificial intelligence research. To minimize the labor involved in dataset creation and enhance dataset quality, this project aims to develop an automatic labeling tool that effectively reduces the human resources cost used for dataset creation.


In my role as a deep learning engineer on the project team, I was responsible for the design and development of the deep learning engine for multi-sensor object detection. This engine integrates into the automatic labeling tool to detect objects in various environments, assigning object class, size, position, rotation, and tracking IDs. As a result, the automatic labeling tool was able to reduce human labor requirements for dataset creation by up to 30%. This achievement not only streamlines the data labeling workflow but also contributes to the scalability of autonomous driving research and development.
