Creating high-quality, large-scale datasets is crucial in artificial intelligence research. This project aims to develop an automatic labeling system to reduce human resource costs in dataset creation and improve dataset quality.

As a deep learning engineer, I designed and developed a deep learning engine for multi-sensor object detection. This engine predicts object class, position, scale, rotation, and track IDs from the collected raw data and generates high-quality annotations for autonomous driving research. Our automatic labeling system can reduce human resource costs for dataset creation by up to 30%.
