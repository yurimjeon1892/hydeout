This project aims to develop an auto-labeling tool that effectively reduces human labor costs by automating the labeling process.

In this project, I undertook the design and development of a deep learning engine for multi-sensor object detection. This engine is integrated into the auto-labeling tool, enhancing its capability to detect objects in diverse environments.

Throughout the project, we achieved a reduction of up to 50% in human labor requirements.  This achievement not only streamlines the data labeling workflow but also contributes to the scalability of autonomous driving research and development.

Continuing on from the initial alpha version's release, this project consistently incorporated feedback from human labelers, resulting in substantial improvements to the auto-labeling tool.
