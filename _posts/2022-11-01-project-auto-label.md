Creating high-quality, large-scale datasets is crucial for artificial intelligence research. This project aims to develop an automatic labeling system to reduce human resource costs in dataset creation and enhance dataset quality.

As a deep learning engineer, I designed and developed a deep learning engine for multi-sensor object detection. This engine predicts object class, position, scale, rotation, and track IDs from raw collected data, generating high-quality annotations for autonomous driving research. Our automatic labeling system reduces human resource costs for dataset creation by up to 30%.
