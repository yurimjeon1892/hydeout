Hello! I'm Yurim Jeon. My research interests lie in developing robust perception systems for autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. My research topics include:

* Image-to-point cloud registration
* Depth completion
* Multi-sensor object detection
* Off-road traversability estimation

As a result of my research, I published two papers as the first author in RA-L and presented my work at IROS. 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Seoul National University. I research a perception system for autonomous driving in off-road environments. Currently, I lead a project estimating traversable spaces in off-road environments.

I have experience as a deep learning engineer at an autonomous driving company, Thordrive. I developed deep learning-based multi-sensor object detection modules for autonomous vehicles and established/maintained an automatic labeling system for a large-scale object detection dataset.

I completed my M.S. and Ph.D. at the Vehicle Intelligence Laboratory at Seoul National University, Republic of Korea. Before that, I obtained my B.S. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University.
