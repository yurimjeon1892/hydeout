Hello! I'm Yurim Jeon. My research interests lie in developing robust perception systems for autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. My research topics include:

* Depth completion
* Image-to-point cloud registration
* Off-road traversability estimation

As a result of my research, I published several papers in RA-L and presented my work at IROS and ICRA. 

Currently, I am an AI/ML Engineer at Boeing Korea, where I apply advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve complex problems in various domains.

Previously, I worked as a research scientist at Thordrive, an autonomous driving company, where I developed deep learning-based multi-sensor object detection modules for autonomous vehicles and established and maintained an automatic labeling system for a large-scale object detection dataset.

Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Seoul National University, where I researched perception systems for autonomous driving in off-road environments, leading a project focused on estimating traversable spaces.

I completed my M.S. and Ph.D. at the Vehicle Intelligence Laboratory at Seoul National University, Republic of Korea. Before that, I obtained my B.S. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University.
