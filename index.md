Hello! I'm Yurim Jeon, and I have a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University. My research focuses on developing robust perception systems for autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. My completed work includes:

* **Image-to-point cloud registration** (self-calibration of camera and LiDAR), which estimates the transformation between an image and a point cloud
* **Depth completion**, which predicts a dense depth map using an image and a point cloud
* **Multi-sensor object detection**
* **Off-road traversability estimation**

As a result of my research, I published two papers as the first author in RA-L and presented my work at IROS. 

I also have experience as a deep learning engineer at an autonomous driving company, where I developed an auto-labeling tool for generating datasets for autonomous driving.
