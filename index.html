Hola! I'm Yurim Jeon, and I have a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University. 



My research focuses on the perception for robotics and autonomous driving. During my graduate course, I also worked as a deep learning engineer at an autonomous driving company, contributing to the development of an auto-labeling tool. Throughout my journey, I have consistently achieved research milestones, with publications in academic journals, conference presentations, and GitHub contributions - as both a researcher and engineer. Currently, I am searching for opportunities as a postdoctoral researcher with a passion for deep exploration of robotic perception systems.
